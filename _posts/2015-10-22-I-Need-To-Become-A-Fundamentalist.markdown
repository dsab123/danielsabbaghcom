I’ve been using all my spare time to work on as many projects as I can, which has been exhilarating to say the least; there’s so much out there in the web development world!

Now that I think I have a basic grasp of what’s going on in web dev right now, it’s high time I buckled down and got really good at a few languages/tools/frameworks. Here’s what I’ll be focusing my efforts on for the foreseeable future:

###Java/Spring
- No getting around this one. I need to meet Java 8’s new awesome features and APIs as well as refamiliarize self with the Core Java API
- I [did a project with Spring boot](http://playhymns.herokuapp.com) once, and it was too easy. Boot handled so much of the configuration that I’m ignorant as to how it works under the surface. Not good. I want to become a Spring Ninja, like the guy on the cover of [Spring In Action](amazon website)
- I’ll need to reread portions of [Spring In Action](see my reading list)

###JavaScript/jQuery/CSS/HTML5
- I’m working through [jQuery in Action](see my reading list), and liking it. I’ll continue.
- I didn’t spend enough time mastering the JavaScript basics; need to do that.
- So, I still don’t know much about HTML5...
- How do I optimize loading times and such for a SPA when making AJAX calls?

###SQL
- I’ve been refamiliarizing myself with MySQL for a few days now, and things are coming easier than they did the first time. Good!
- Hopefully I can update the terrible db that Playhymns queries...

###maven/git
- I know all I need to know to manage projects by myself, but I need a deeper understanding of how to collaborate with others on projects. I need to find some good developers to code with :/
- I never really did much with Maven, I’m afraid. Those POMs got so large!
- Gradle? Should I learn Gradle?

###nginx
- Since its leaner than apache, it should be simpler to learn, and from what I’ve read, can handle requests much faster since it’s event-based rather than process-based.

###Testing

- I’ll go over [The Art Of Unit Testing](reading list) and [Practical Unit Testing](reading list)
- I should learn how to unit test JavaScript; QUnit would be good for this, I suppose.
- Need more experience with Chrome Developer Tools
- Selenium? I completely forgot about Selenium!

Aw, shucks. That’s a lot.

And how long after I get good at one will another come to take its place? These all seem to be pretty standard, so they’re probably not going away in the next 3-5 years to say the least. That being said, I think I should focus on the ones that are
more important,
potentially longer-lasting than the others

Here’s my ranking of all these according to the criteria above (I’ll leave off testing, as its not so much a framework or tool, and is a given anyway):

1. Java/Spring
2. JavaScript/jQuery/CSS/HTML5
3. git
4. SQL, although I should eventually play with NoSQL databases at some point


Some observations:
- I can probably learn all I need to know about nginx in a week or so. I don’t anticipate needing to learn the complexities involved with handling ten thousand clients simultaneously, or anything like that...
- I’ll go with Gradle over Maven for now, as it seems more hipster and cool
- I didn't test PlayHymns too well, so I'll need to do that

So, that’s where I’m at.

PlayHymns was a very maturing experience for me; I think I’ll work on optimizing it in every area that the shorter list above touches, and move the build system over to gradle.
