This year, I read more books than I ever have. I can't take much of the credit for this, I'm afraid. Much thanks to Tim Challies and his [productivity system](http://www.challies.com/domorebetter), which I highly recommend.

It's truly been a great year of book reading; I've treasured every one of the books that I read this year (pictured above). Some were read immediately after they were purchased (much credit to Crossway's marketing campaigns), while others I've read after having become accustomed to their location in my bookshelf.

I began to arrange the books in order from most cherished to least. It seemed to be a rather easy task at its outset. I was satisfied with my choice of the two books that I placed on each end of this spectrum. After that, it became much more difficult. Hence, the only order in this stack is at its top and bottom.

##*Confessions*, Saint Augustine

One of the most beautiful books I have ever read. It is written as a chronological, biographical prayer of confession from Augustine to God Himself. At times, his words are so littered with expressions found in the psalms and other passages of Scripture; its wonderful and delightful to see! For example, the opening paragraph of the book reads: 

>"'You are great, Lord, and highly to be praised (Ps. 47:2): great is Your power and Your wisdom is immeasurable' (Ps. 146:5). Man, a little piece of Your creation, desires to praise You, a human being 'bearing his mortality with him' (2 Cor 4:10), carrying with him the witness of his sin and the witness of that You 'resist the proud' (1 Pet. 5:5). Nevertheless, to praise You is the desire of man, a little piece of Your creation. You stir man to take pleasure in praising You, because **You have made us for Yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in You.**"

Needless to say, I plan on reading this book every year for the rest of my life. How it flies my soul straight to the Lord in prayer!

##*Rejoicing In Christ*, Michael Reeves

This British Theologian has been a great blessing to read. Not pictured the stack is another books of his that I read this year, *Delighting in the Trinity*. 
 
Both books are devotional-theological in nature. The aim of *Delighting in the Trinity* is to rekindle a love for this most peculiar doctrine of Christian orthodoxy. For it is not just a fact that we must give some assent to and move on, but a revelation of who God is at His essence. God is a Trinity. He has revealed Himself to us as Father, Son, and Spirit. Each chapter of this book focuses on each person of this Triune Being that Christians have worshipped throughout all history.

*Rejoicing in Christ* is a book that, well, the title says it all. As with Augustine's *Confessions*, I quote from the first paragraph of the book:

>Jesus Christ, God's perfect Son, is the Beloved of the Father, the Song of the Angels, the Logic of Creation, the great Mystery of Godliness, the bottomless Spring of life, comfort, and joy. We were made to find our satisfaction, our heart's rest, in Him.

(Can you spot the Augustinian-ness of the second sentence?)

Each chapter chronicles a different stage of the life of the Son: The first chapter examines His relationship with His Father from eternity past (we believe Jesus Christ was not a created being, but *created* all other beings; see John 1:1,14); the second, His Incarnation and subsequent life on earth all the way through to His death; the third, His Ascension and Intercession; and the fourth, His Life in the believer through the indwelling of the Spirit.

##The Rest, in no particular order

###*God's Love*, R.C. Sproul

A nice, comprehensive overview of the Love of God. Much Scripture is opened and expounded, from polarizing passages like Romans 9, to those that have become trite and have subsequently lost their meaning, like 1 John 4:8 ("God is Love"; what does that even mean anymore?).

###*Lit*, Tony Reinke

The first six chapters are an amazing "Theology of Book Reading," as I believe he terms it. The third chapter is worth 100 times its weight in gold. He explores how, especially in our screen-centered culture, our minds have been conditioned to intake information through our eyes rather than our ears, when ideally there should be a mixture of both. Delving into the scene at Mount Sinai, he shows how this was also the case with stiff-necked Israel, who, rather than hearing the very Words of God with their ears, wanted to see an image with their eyes. They were all too willing to give up the jewelry they had obtained from the Egyptians for that end. "The adornment of the ear was sacrificed in order to create an image pleasing to the eye. The ear (the receiver of God's Word) was plundered for the eye (the receiver of the image) (pp. 41)."

###*Weakness Is The Way*, J.I. Packer


###Biographies

I've fallen in love with Christian Biographies! *Shadow of the Almighty* is a compilation of Jim Elliot's life drawn from letters written to and from him, as well as excerpts from his journals. This man had a heart of devotion for the Lord that was unparalleled in his day. An excerpt from one of his journal entries: 

>"The principle of getting by spending is illustrated by the actions of God: *'He had yet one, a Beloved Son.'* *'He giveth not the Spirit by measure.'* *'He spared not His own Son.'* *'He emptied Himself.'* Is heaven the poorer for this spending? Nay, both heaven and earth are enriched by it. Who dare not follow God's example?"

The autobiographical works by the author, Elliot's wife, are filled with this principle I've dubbed 'give to get.'

###*Safe Haven*, Nicholas Sparks

The only reason I read this book was because Carl Trueman, my favorite church historian, recommended it on his podcast. I was not aware that this Nicholas Sparks was the same author who wrote *The Notebook*. Had I known, I probably would not have read it. It's a full-fledged love story. It was alright, I guess. 

Just kidding. It was amazing. I didn't know I could feel so much. Not so sure I *liked* being able to feel. Dull Daniel is a predictable Daniel. I *like* predictable Daniel.

###*The King James Only Controversy*, James White

A very helpful resource that goes into detail on whether other translations besides the Old King Jimmy are reliabe or not. I praise the Lord for this one, it got me through some difficult times this year.
