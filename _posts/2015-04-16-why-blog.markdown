#Hello.

##Why start a blog, you ask?

Well, I recently came to the conclusion that I had become lazy with respect to my career development and growth.

I have a degree and the necessary ability to learn almost any new technology out there, yet I had grown comfortable in my own space and
had stopped challenging myself.

Thereafter I immediately realized that I had been wasting the last year and a half since I'd been out of school. I could have learned so much..

No more.

I realize that I know almost nothing, but for the last few months I've been learning any new concept, tool, or framework I can get my hands on.

Some of more prominent ones the following:
* Unit Testing [The Art Of Unit Testing](http://www.manning.com/osherove/)
	* Junit, Mockito: [Practical Unit Testing](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Unit-Testing-JUnit-Mockito/dp/8393489393)
	* QUnit (eventually)
* Web-based Integration Testing
	* Selenium; this IS an integration testing suite, is it not?)
* Spring: [Spring In Action](http://www.manning.com/walls4/), a [simple project using Spring Boot](https://github.com/dsab123/PlayHymn3)

###This blog will help me to track my progress in my growth and understanding of these things, as well as any others I may pick up along the way.

###The other main reason for this blog is for me to practice my writing. 

I've noticed that if I can't communicate something effectively, whether in speaking or writing, then I really don't understand it that well.

In short, I'll be blogging my progress and growth as a software developer.

This blog will be hosted on a Digital Ocean Droplet. Digital Ocean is pretty cool.

##So this blog is mainly for me.

###Not you.
Go away and spend your time reading something worthwhile. :)
