I wrote [another post today]({% post_url 2015-12-31-A-Year-In-Review-In-Books %}), summarizing the books I read this year. After picking up and leafing through Augustine's *Confessions*, I couldn't help but post this longer quote.


>"But when I love you, what do I love? It is not physical beauty nor temporal glory nor the brightness of light so dear to earthly eyes, nor the the sweet melodies of all kinds of songs, nor the gentle odour of flowers and ointments and perfumes, nor mannna or honey, nor limbs welcoming the embraces of the flesh; it is not these I love when I love my God. Yet there is a light I love,  and a food, and a kind of embrace when I love my God - a light, voice, odour, food, embrace of my inner man, where my soul is floodlit by light which space cannot contain, where there is sound that time cannot seize, where there is a perfume which no breeze disperses, where there is a taste for food no amount of eating can lessen, and where there is a bond of union that no satiety can part, That is what I love when I love my God."
