Welcome to my first post of the new year! For all of you who found this site through my LinkedIn, no, it’s not a technical post. I actually haven’t written one of those in a while..

I have been reading John Owen’s classic *The Mortification of Sin*, which is an exhortation to believers to “mortify the deeds of the body” (Romans 8:13b). It is an immensely practical book, and one to which I’ll be returning frequently. I’m using the [Banner of Truth’s Puritan Paperback edition](https://banneroftruth.org/us/store/christian-living/the-mortification-of-sin/), which is a modernized abridgment of the original work.

I plan to blog through the whole book at the pace of one post per chapter, reproducing Owen’s outline for each chapter and working through what he’s teaching.

But before we get to the actual book, I’d like us to consider two questions: What is mortification, and why blog through this book as opposed to others?


###Mortification? What that mean?

Christian Theology teaches that when a person becomes a Christian (which does not occur merely by their own choice, but is rather a sovereign act of God to which he responds), among other things, he is given a new nature that loves God and His Word, and delights to please Him. The new believer is full of joy as he is reminded that all his sins have been payed for by Christ, and he revels in this thought whenever the Lord brings it to his mind. However, all is not happy rainbows and puppies for the new believer. In fact, the new believer will find out all-too-soon that though the sinful inclinations he possessed before he was saved have been weakened, they have not been fully snuffed out. The old mindset, tendencies, and desires still exist. The Scripture lumps all these things together and calls them the ‘old man.' Conversely, the new nature that desires to please God is called the ‘new man,’ or sometimes the 'flesh'. The Apostle Paul exhorts believers in the Letter to the Ephesians to individually put off, or lay aside the old man:

>"...that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness" (Ephesians 4:22-24 NKJV).

The Apostle ends out the chapter, and continues into the next one, with specific instructions of how believers are to put off the old man by replacing specific sins with alternative good works. For example, he commands believers not to lie to each other any longer, but only speak truth with each other (4:25). So Christians are to swap out bad behaviors, or sins, for good behaviors.

However, though Christians know what is good and what is evil, and we know what is required to perform good instead of evil, we find that it is a very hard task to actually accomplish (unbelievers find the same things to be true; Owen explains how the non-Christian relates to this in his Introduction to the book, which we’ll get to in the next post). As our new believer discovers in his own failings, Christians are saved from the punishment of sin but not from the remaining effects of sin in their bodies. Paul tells us in another place that “the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish” (Galatians 5:17). Believers are plunged into a war the moment they are converted, with their new desires fighting against their old desires. It is not at all as if Christians, upon making an outward profession of faith, can just sit back and embrace the sin they enjoyed before. The Bible is filled with commands from God to reject the old man and the sin that comes with him, and to embrace the new man, doing good works for the benefit of others, and ultimately for His Glory. And Christians, as God’s children, are called to obey Him.

Which brings us to the verse of which this whole book is an exposition: “For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live” (Romans 8:13 KJV). The NKJV, which is a bit more modern, renders this verse as such: “For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Sprit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live” (Romans 8:13 NKJV). Here is given to us the battle plan, if you will, of this war into which our new believer has been thrust: If we live in accordance with our old nature, our flesh, we will die, but if we “mortify” (put to death) the sinful workings and inclinations of our old man, we will live<sup>[1](#note)</sup>.

Mortification, thus, is the putting to death of the sinful actions and thoughts of our hearts. *Mortification Of Sin* is an exposition of what exactly this means and how believers can do this work for their benefit and the glory of God.


###Why blog through this one?
As has been mentioned before, this book is an extremely practical one! The pages drip with knowledge of how Christians can arm themselves to fight against the sin that grieves them. The Apostle explains this desire of all who are born of God perfectly: 

>“For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do… I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin” (Romans 7:14-15,21-25). 

This struggle against sin is not just some theological fancy that the academically-inclined enjoy thinking about; this is an immensely personal struggle. I have found Owen’s writings very helpful, and I’ll need to review them frequently.

So, that’s why.

Next post will cover Owen’s Preface, the Publisher's Foreword, and the Introduction. Thanks for reading!


If you’ve managed to read this far into the post and you’re not a Christian, I commend you! I hope I’ve made this work of mortification, which is absolutely central to the Christian life, plain to understand. If you want to learn more about anything I’ve written, please drop me a line. My email should be somewhere on this page (with my wonky noob-level web skillz I can’t guarantee exactly where on the page it’ll be, unfortunately). If you live in the Montgomery County area, come visit our [church](http://www.trcofg.org) one Sunday morning.
