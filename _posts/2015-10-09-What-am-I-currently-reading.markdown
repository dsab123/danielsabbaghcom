In the last few years I've tried to diversify my reading, as [Albert Mohler has advised](http://www.albertmohler.com/2007/09/12/some-thoughts-on-the-reading-of-books/). He splits his reading into six categories: Theology, Biblical Studies, Church Life, History, Cultural Studies, and Literature. I've slightly modified his categories to fit my own preferences and interests: Theology, Technical, Everything else. I subdivide Theologicial works into the following: Theology, Church Stuff, Biography, and History.

Augustine famously said, "I count myself one of the number of those who write as they learn and learn as they write." I do too. Of course, the rate at which I read through a book is slowed down considerably because of my note-taking, underlining, and writing angry messages to the authors in the page margins, but when I finally do finish the book I have a handy set of homemade cliffs notes on the topic.

I'll eventually list all the books I've read in the last few years, with a few thoughts on each. I'll add more books I've read to this list as I find the time.

Unfortunately, I'm not great at CSS and HTML layouts, and so I'll leave off my thoughts for now.
