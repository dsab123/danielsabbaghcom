So, it's been nearly a month without a blog post. Not good, Daniel, not good.

Wait, I can explain!

I've been working on a new layout for this site, which I finally pushed into production just a few moments ago. If you're reading this post, then you are experiencing the new layout. I apologize. 

What's good is that capistrano stores all released versions of this site, so if I start getting hate mail for how bad the site looks, I can always revert back to the primitive layout *I* hated so much.

The new layout is [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com)-based. I've used bootstrap on a few [projects](/tag/playhymns), and I absolutely love how easy it is to work with.

I may write more about the layout changes in the near future.

But before that, I'll need to learn how to make the new layout work well for mobile. Because it looks terrible right now.
