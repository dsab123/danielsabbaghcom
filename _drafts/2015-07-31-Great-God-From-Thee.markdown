So if you're an avid reader of my blog you'll know that [I really like hymns]({% post_url 2015-07-25-My-First-Web-Project %}).

I came across the following hymn this morning, written by [John Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Newton), called 'Great God, From Thee."

Newton was an prolific hymn writer, who penned a couple hundred hymns in his lifetime.

I am particularly fond of those hymns of his that follow a narrative pattern. He was a great storyteller!

Here are the lyrics to the hymn, arranged by [Indelible Grace](http://hymnbook.igracemusic.com/hymns/great-god-from-thee).

>Great God from Thee there's nought concealed, 
Thou seest my inward frame;
To Thee I always stand revealed, 
Exactly as I am.

>Since I can hardly therefore bear, 
What in myself I see
How vile and dark must I appear 
Most holy God to Thee?

>But since my Savior stands between, 
In garments dyed in blood,
Tis He instead of me is seen
When I approach to God.

>Thus though a sinner, I am safe, 
He pleads before the throne
His life and death in my behalf, 
And calls my sins His own.

>What wondrous love, what mysteries, 
In this appointed shine!
My breaches of the law are His, 
And His obedience mine.


A few observations:

The first verse reminds me of Psalm 139, in which King David marvels in God's complete knowledge of him. The first four verses elaborate on this concept:

>O Lord, You have searched me and known me.
You know my sitting down and my rising up;
You understand my thought afar off.
You comprehend my path and my lying down,
And are acquainted with all my ways.
For there is not a word on my tongue,
But behold, O Lord, You know it altogether.

Another verse that comes to mind is Hebrews 4:13:

>And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.

The Reformers of the 16 century, as well as the Puritans that followed them, taught that we should always live as though we were before the face of God; "Coram Deo" is the Latin phrase that encapsulates this idea.


In the next verse, the sinner groans at the thought of how "vile and dark" he must look to God because of his sin when he can hardly bear with how dirty he is in his own eyes. He knows that the Lord is "of purer eyes than to see evil (Habakkuk 1:13)", and is fearful and grieved not only at his own estimation of his sinfulness, but God's pure and righteous estimation of his sinfulness.

Not only are we unable to help ourselves when we consider our sinfulness, but our own eyes are utterly incapable of even seeing it in its rightful light! We, as Eliphaz says, "drink iniquity like water (Job 15:16)."

Again, this theme is all but prevalent in the Scriptures; the Psalmist writes, "If You, Lord, should count iniquities, Oh Lord, who could stand? (Psalm 130:3)." David echoes in Psalm 19:12: "Who can understand his [own] errors? Cleanse me from secret faults."


For those of us who have repented of our sins and have trusted in Christ, there is much cause to rejoice when we see ourselves in the first two verses, because we know "Our Savior stands between" us and God. The "garments dyed in blood" are dyed with the blood of Jesus Christ our Savior. He "suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God (Hebrews 9:14)."

The Puritans spoke of this great exchange: Christ's righteousness for our own sin. This is expressed most clearly, it seems to me, in 2 Corinthians 5:21: "He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him." In Christ's Passion, we were given His righteousness, and He was given our sin. When Jesus died, so did the punishment for my sin, as well as all who would trust in Him. This is the essence and scandal of the Gospel, that we who deserve God's wrath and judgement for our sins are spared and instead given the perfect righteousness of Christ.

When God the Father looks at me, He loves me as He loves the Son (John 17:23), since all punishment for my sin has already been paid for and I am legally considered, in Christ, to have the righteousness He requires. Therefore I can have boldness to approach the throne of God (Hebrews 4:15,16) if I approach in the Name of Jesus, the "one who loved me and gave Himself for me (Galatians 2:20)."

How sweet it is to the soul that access to the Creator and Sustainer of all things is so rich and free!


Hymns like these, that are so gospel-centered and written from the pen of one whose mind has been saturated in Scripture, are a joy to sing quietly to ourselves when we are alone. It was Augustine who said, "He who sings prays twice."

To think on the truths presented in this hymn and others like it bring relief to the anxious, weary mind. As we remind ourselves of all the spiritual blessings we have in Christ, we can say with David, "return to thy rest, Oh my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee (Psalm 116:7)."
