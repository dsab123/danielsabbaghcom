## A simple website created with Jekyll

I will use this site to track my progress in growth as a software developer as the years go by.

Simple as that.

I'm planning to host this site on [Digital Ocean](digitalocean.com)

That's it for now. The next few days I'll be throwing myself at Jekyll and learning all there is to know about it.
